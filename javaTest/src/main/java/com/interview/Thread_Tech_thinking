Sometimes need to break down problem and think -> how should one thread work in existing
scenario.

Like for printing any series.

---------

Sometimes code is running just because you put it in correct order. change it.

-------

Think in terms of all threads spawned concurrently and calling methods.

//basic code:
synchronized(obj)
    {
        while (condition_matched)
        {
            obj.wait();
        }
        //continue
        dosomething();
        notify()
    }

     while (!transfer) {
                    wait();
            }
            transfer = false;

            this.packet = packet;
            notifyAll();

-------------------------
in class Print_123123123_nThreads
I was mistaking by not putting obj.wait(). as used synch block.

when series use if instead of while

when we call wait() â€“ this forces the current thread to wait until some other thread invokes notify() or notifyAll() on the same object.
For this, the current thread must own the object's monitor.

notify work only on threads who are waiting.
