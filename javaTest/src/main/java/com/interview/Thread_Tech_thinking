Sometimes need to break down problem and think -> how should one thread work in existing
scenario.

Like for printing any series.

---------

Sometimes code is running just because you put it in correct order. change it.

-------

Think in terms of all threads spawned concurrently and calling methods.


//basic code:
synchronized(obj)
    {
        while (condition_not_matched)
        {
            obj.wait();
        }
        //continue
        dosomething();
        notify()
    }

-------------------------
in class Print_123123123_nThreads
I was mistaking by not putting obj.wait(). as used synch block.
