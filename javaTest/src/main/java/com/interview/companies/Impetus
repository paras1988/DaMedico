1. Hive - partition vs bucketing - why used hive

partitioning - partition data on column having very few distinct records, example country column.
bucketing - partition on basis of column having more distinct records(may be after partitioning is done), example primary key
               it make buckets on the basis of hash.


2. shuffle and sort
3. performance issues in MR and Flink

    flink: checkpoint_monitoring -> to know if we have to tune it.
            1. Tuning Checkpointing : sometimes there is so much data that checkpointing time is
            more than the frequency of checkpoint. so we have to tune it.
            2. Make state checkpointing Asynchronous : by DB or value state
                    2a. tune rocksdb

           Capacity Planning -> to do the back pressure monitoring
            1. some extra resources for back pressure


4. why couchbase

5. how hive queries work internally, how udf work internally
    1. create plan (use metastore), optimize, compile and execute ( as MR jobs in which
    one join is like 1 map and reduce job, where clause as table scan)

6. spark - dag

7. index offset big file get start and end
8. difference btw avro parquet ORC
