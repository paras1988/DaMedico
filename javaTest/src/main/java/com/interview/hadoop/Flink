dataset Transformation:

 map flatmap groupby sum filter

------------------
 datastream Transformation:

 map flatmap keyby( keyby is like groupby in dataset)sum filter
datasource = addsource
operation: map reduce fold
aggregation: min max avg sum
split -


Window : tumblin sliding session global

flow: window created -> Trigger -> window function

Evictor - remove element .can be called anywhere.

Watermark - mechanism to measure progress


state and checkpoint - fault tolerance

valuestate - convert stateless to stateful

broadcast state - like distributed cache

FLINK vs SPARK:

Flink: continous data operator(map, key..) based model.
It used controlled cyclic dependency graph
Spark: micro batching
