CREATE TABLE table_name (column1 data_type, column2 data_type) PARTITIONED BY (partition1 data_type, partition2 data_type,….);

CREATE TABLE table_name PARTITIONED BY (partition1 data_type, partition2 data_type,….) CLUSTERED BY (column_name1, column_name2, …)
 SORTED BY (column_name [ASC|DESC], …)] INTO num_buckets BUCKETS;


Dept: A B C -- 3 partition of each dept

B can have n no. of buckets.


Execution:

Few internals:

Hive
driver compiler metadata execution engine.

above will send plan to Hadoop
Hadoop
job_tracker  task_trackers(Map)  task_trackers(Reduce) HDFS::  Namenode datanodes

hive optimization:

tez engine
bucketing
partitioning
De-normalizing data
Compress map/reduce output:
ORC format - columnar for analytics..
