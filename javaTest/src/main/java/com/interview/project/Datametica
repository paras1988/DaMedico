Import logs from Tables:

Use sqoop : RDBMS to HDFS in avro format.
Now we have avro data and avsc files (created before hand) , by avroserde we generate hive
external tables(new hdfs location) on it. E.g join dbqlogtbl_hst and dbqlsqltbl_hst to generate
query_log_e.

From avros create Logs and metadata dictionary for lookup.
On fly lookups for drop create distributed cache

   Strategy-  - encapsulate interface details in a base class, and
   bury implementation details in derived classes. Clients can then couple themselves to an interface

   Singleton
