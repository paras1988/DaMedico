1. Object has monitor
By Synchronize keyword Thread takes that monitor.

Thats why when in a class different methods have synchronized only one get called from one thread.
Because of monitor of instance acquired by Thread.

*static methods have class level monitor.


2. Understand it via example for clarity.(Important)
   wait( ) tells the calling thread to give up the monitor and go to sleep until some other
   thread enters the same monitor and calls notify( ).
   notify( ) wakes up the first thread that called wait( ) on the same object.
   notifyAll( ) wakes up all the threads that called wait( ) on the same object.


---------
Volatile:  Directly memory access, not cached by thread.
Non-volatile: Each thread has copy in CPU cache.

----------
ConcurrentHashmap:
Only locks segment of table while writing.Readers can work on other segment.
Fail-safe.

Synchronized Map:
Just a wrapper on hashmap. to get thread safe map.
All members are synchronized. get, put, (Think of it why if dont remember)
